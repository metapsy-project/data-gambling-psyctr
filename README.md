The `data-gambling-psyctr` dataset is a meta-analytic research domain [MARD](https://docs.metapsy.org/uploads/ebmental-2022-300509.pdf)) which is part of the  [Metapsy project](https://www.metapsy.org/). The dataset contains study information and effect size data of randomized trials on psychological interventions for problem gambling and gambling disorder. The date of the last search update is provided [here](https://github.com/metapsy-project/data-gambling-psyctr/blob/main/metadata/last_search.txt). A published meta-analysis using part of the data from this database can be accessed [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.16221).

This dataset includes psychological interventions (CBT, motivational interventions, personalized feedback, etc) vs. control comparisons. Effect sizes are provided for three types of gambling-related outcomes ("gambling_outcome") at post-test and at follow-up: 1) Gambling disorder severity (measured using a variety of measures with some reliability and validity support, including the gambling subscale of the Addiction Severity Index, Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale, the Problem Gambling Severity Index, etc.), 2) Gambling frequency (e.g., number of times gambled), and 3) Gambling intensity (e.g., money spent on gambling), and 4) Gambling duration. Additionally, this dataset also includes data on [other outcomes](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2023-48432-001) such as anxiety, depression, quality of life, and substance use ("outcome_domain").

The dataset follows the [Metapsy data standard](https://docs.metapsy.org/data-preparation/format/).
