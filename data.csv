There is substantial investment in publicly funded intervention services, but limited evaluation of effectiveness. This study investigated three brief telephone interventions to determine whether they were more effective than standard helpline treatment in helping people to reduce gambling. Design: Randomized clinical trial. Setting: National gambling helpline in New Zealand. Participants: A total of 462 adults with problem gambling. INTERVENTIONS AND COMPARATOR: (1) Single motivational interview (MI), (2) single motivational interview plus cognitive-behavioural self-help workbook (MI + W) and (3) single motivational interview plus workbook plus four booster follow-up telephone interviews (MI + W + B). Comparator was helpline standard care [treatment as usual (TAU)]. Blinded follow-up was at 3, 6 and 12 months. Measurements: Primary outcomes were days gambled, dollars lost per day and treatment goal success. Findings: There were no differences across treatment arms, although participants showed large reductions in gambling during the 12-month follow-up period [mean reduction of 5.5 days, confidence interval (CI) = 4.8, 6.2; NZ$38 lost ($32, $44; 80.6%), improved (77.2%, 84.0%)]. Subgroup analysis revealed improved days gambled and dollars lost for MI + W + B over MI or MI + W for a goal of reduction of gambling (versus quitting) and improvement in dollars lost by ethnicity, gambling severity and psychological distress (all P < 0.01). MI + W + B was associated with greater treatment goal success for higher gambling severity than TAU or MI at 12 months and also better for those with higher psychological distress and lower self-efficacy to MI (all P < 0.01). TAU and MI were found to be equivalent in terms of dollars lost. Conclusions: In treatment of problem gambling in New Zealand, brief telephone interventions are associated with changes in days gambling and dollars lost similar to more intensive interventions, suggesting that more treatment is not necessarily better than less.

We hypothesized that the intervention group would show a greater reduction in both depressive and gambling-related symptoms compared to a wait-list control group.

Results: ITT analyses showed that the intervention led to a significant reduction in depressive symptoms as well as gambling-related symptoms compared to the control group, with moderate to strong effect sizes. PP analyses failed to yield significant results due to high rates of non-completion and limited statistical power. Moderator analyses indicated that Deprexis was particularly beneficial in reducing problematic gambling for those scoring high on baseline gambling-related symptoms and for those who gamble due to loneliness.

Problematic gambling was measured with the Pathological Gambling Adaptation of Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (PG-YBOCS) and the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS). The trial is registered with the German Registry for Clinical Studies (DRKS00013888). Results: ITT analyses showed that the intervention led to a significant reduction in depressive symptoms as well as gambling-related symptoms compared to the control group, with moderate to strong effect sizes. PP analyses failed to yield significant results due to high rates of non-completion and limited statistical power. Moderator analyses indicated that Deprexis was particularly beneficial in reducing problematic gambling for those scoring high on baseline gambling-related symptoms and for those who gamble due to loneliness. Discussion: Results of the present study suggest that Deprexis might be a useful adjunct to traditional interventions for the treatment of problematic gambling.

Despite a high demand for treatment and negative financial consequences, only a small fraction of problematic and pathological gamblers seek professional help. The existing treatment gap could be narrowed by providing low-threshold, anonymous internet-based interventions. The aim of the present study was to examine the acceptance and efficacy of an online-intervention for depression (“Deprexis”) in a sample of problematic and pathological slot-machine gamblers. We hypothesized that the intervention group would show a greater reduction in both depressive and gambling-related symptoms compared to a wait-list control group. Method: A total of 140 individuals with self-reported gambling and mood problems were randomly allocated either to the intervention group or to a wait-list control group. After 8 weeks, all participants were invited for re-assessment. The Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9) served as the primary outcome assessment.

Fifty-six female pathological gamblers with electronic gaming machine gambling problems were randomly assigned to the control (waiting list) group or one of the treatment groups (individual or group treatment). Treatment comprised a 12-session program including financial limit setting, alternative activity planning, cognitive correction, problem solving, communication training, relapse prevention, and imaginal desensitisation. Treatment outcome was evaluated with conceptually related measures within the areas of gambling behaviour and psychological functioning. While individual and group treatment formats generally produced comparable outcomes in terms of gambling behaviour and psychological functioning, group treatment failed to produce superior outcomes to the control group in relation to several measures of psychological functioning.

This study examined the effectiveness of group cognitive-behavioural therapy (GCBT) on pathological gambling among Nigerian students. The study used a group randomised controlled trial design to assign participants to intervention and control groups. A total of 40 undergraduate students, aged 18–30, were classified as pathological gamblers (participants) in this study. Participants completed self-report scales titled South oaks gambling screen and Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale at three-time points. The intervention lasted for 8 weeks. The data collected were statistically analysed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Results revealed that GCBT has a significant effect in decreasing the symptoms of pathological gambling among the participants in GCBT compared to those in the control group and that the improvements were maintained at follow-up. The study concluded that group cognitive-behavioural therapy is impactful therapy in reducing pathological gambling among students. It has also validated the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy in altering erroneous thoughts and replacing it with a better alternative realistic way of thinking.";"Assessment of the Effectiveness of Group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy in Reducing Pathological Gambling";"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-020-09981-y";"Journal of Gambling Studies";"Ede, 2020";"Ede_2020_msd_followup_4_gambling_severity_gsas_cbt_wl_NA_NA";-7,15843870106325;0,875654958413296;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

This study examined the effectiveness of group cognitive-behavioural therapy (GCBT) on pathological gambling among Nigerian students. The study used a group randomised controlled trial design to assign participants to intervention and control groups. A total of 40 undergraduate students, aged 18–30, were classified as pathological gamblers (participants) in this study. Participants completed self-report scales titled South oaks gambling screen and Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale at three-time points. The intervention lasted for 8 weeks. The data collected were statistically analysed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Results revealed that GCBT has a significant effect in decreasing the symptoms of pathological gambling among the participants in GCBT compared to those in the control group and that the improvements were maintained at follow-up. The study concluded that group cognitive-behavioural therapy is impactful therapy in reducing pathological gambling among students. It has also validated the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy in altering erroneous thoughts and replacing it with a better alternative realistic way of thinking.";"Assessment of the Effectiveness of Group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy in Reducing Pathological Gambling";"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-020-09981-y";"Journal of Gambling Studies";"Ede, 2020";"Ede_2020_msd_post_8_gambling_severity_gsas_cbt_wl_NA_NA";-6,67401157757693;0,824367230928272;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Improvements were sustained until last follow-up. Compared to the WL, users of EC had beneficiary results in the problem gambling severity (d = 0.74; p = 0.022). No significant effect differences were found between CO and EC. However, according to process evaluation, users of CO reported a significantly stronger working alliance than users of EC (d = 0.70; p = 0.019) and used the intervention considerably longer (d = 0.84; p = 0.004). CO helps treatment-seeking individuals to sustainably reduce their gambling behavior and to increase their general well-being. Compared to EC, CO seems a better support option, since its effects include a wider range of outcomes. Possible reasons are the more engaging program structure and elements of CO, as well as the closer interaction between client and counselor.";"Web‑Based Intervention and Email‑Counseling for Problem Gamblers: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial";"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-019-09883-8";"Journal of Gambling Studies";"Jonas, 2020";"Jonas_2020_msd_post_12_qol_NA_who-5_otherpsy_wl_Email_wl";0,253082422321869;0,188913447373559;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Gamblers, meeting DSM-IV criteria for pathological gambling, were randomly assigned to treatment (N=34) or wait-list control (N=24) conditions. Cognitive correction techniques were used first to target gamblers’ erroneous perceptions about randomness, and then to address issues of relapse prevention. The dependent measures used were the DSM-IV criteria for pathological gambling, perceived self-efficacy, gamblers’ perception of control, desire to gamble, and frequency of gambling. Post-treatment results indicated that 88% of the treated gamblers no longer met the DSM-IV criteria for pathological gambling compared to only 20% in the control group.

The efficacy of three modalities of Internet-based psychotherapy for non–treatment-seeking online problem gamblers: A randomized controlled trial. Journal of Medical Internet Research, 18(2), e36.";"10.2196/jmir.4752";"Background: Internet-based interventions targeted at the most at-risk gamblers could reduce the treatment gap for addictive disorders. Currently, no clinical trial has included non–treatment-seeking patients who have been recruited directly in their gambling environment. This study was the first exclusively Internet-based randomized controlled trial among non–help-seeking problem gamblers with naturalistic recruitment in their gambling environment. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of three modalities of Internet-based psychotherapies with or without guidance, compared to a control condition, among problem gamblers who play online poker. Methods: All active poker gamblers on the Winamax website were systematically offered screening. All problem poker gamblers identified with a Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) score of ≥5 were eligible to be included in the trial. Problem gamblers were randomized into four groups: (1) waiting list (control group), (2) personalized normalized feedback on their gambling status by email, (3) an email containing a self-help book to be downloaded with a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) program without guidance, and (4) the same CBT program emailed weekly by a trained psychologist with personalized guidance. Efficacy was assessed based on the change in PGSI between baseline and 6 weeks (end of treatment) or 12 weeks (maintenance) and supported by player account-based gambling data automatically collected at the three time points. Results: All groups met high attrition rates (83%), but the group with guidance had a significantly higher dropout rate than the other three groups, including the control group. Although all groups showed some improvement, with a mean decrease of 1.35 on the PGSI, no significant difference in efficacy between the groups was observed. One-third of the problem gamblers fell below the problem gambling threshold at 6 weeks. Conclusions: Guidance could have aversively affected problem gamblers who had not sought help.

Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of three modalities of Internet-based psychotherapies with or without guidance, compared to a control condition, among problem gamblers who play online poker. Methods: All active poker gamblers on the Winamax website were systematically offered screening. All problem poker gamblers identified with a Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) score of ≥5 were eligible to be included in the trial. Problem gamblers were randomized into four groups: (1) waiting list (control group), (2) personalized normalized feedback on their gambling status by email, (3) an email containing a self-help book to be downloaded with a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) program without guidance, and (4) the same CBT program emailed weekly by a trained psychologist with personalized guidance. Efficacy was assessed based on the change in PGSI between baseline and 6 weeks (end of treatment) or 12 weeks (maintenance) and supported by player account-based gambling data automatically collected at the three time points. Results: All groups met high attrition rates (83%), but the group with guidance had a significantly higher dropout rate than the other three groups, including the control group.

Forty-nine participants meeting criteria for pathological gambling were recruited from local newspaper advertisements. These participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: TSF (n = 11), CBGT-mapping (n = 18), and Wait-List control (n = 9); 11 refused treatment prior to randomization. Outcome measures included number of DSM-IV criteria met, perception of control/self-efficacy, desire to gamble, and frequency of gambling episodes. Analyses revealed a significant treatment group × time interaction (η²partial = .39). Specifically, the group treatments resulted in significant improvements in the dependent measures, while the Wait-List group remained relatively stable.

Participants were 255 students who met our screening criteria for ‘‘problem’’ or ‘‘pathological’’ gambling, and were randomized to one of three conditions: personalized feedback and follow-up targeted text messages (PFB-TXT); personalized feedback and follow-up educational information about gambling (PFB-EDU); and a control condition that received no personalized feedback or follow-up text messages. Dependent variables included percent days abstinent (PDA) from gambling, average amount wagered on a gambling day, and gambling-related problems.

Design, Setting, and Participants:  This single-center randomized clinical trial was conducted from July 13, 2021, to December 31, 2022, at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. Participants were recruited across Germany for 2 assessments (before intervention [t0] and 6 weeks after intervention [t1]). Eligible participants were individuals aged 18 to 75 years with gambling problems, internet access, German proficiency, and willingness to participate in 2 online assessments. Intervention: The self-guided internet-based intervention was based on cognitive behavioral therapy, metacognitive training, acceptance and commitment therapy, and motivational interviewing. Main Outcome and Measures: The primary outcome was change in gambling-related thoughts and behavior as measured with the pathological gambling adaption of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. Secondary outcomes were change in depressive symptoms, gambling severity, gambling-specific dysfunctional thoughts, attitudes toward online interventions, treatment expectations, and patient satisfaction. Results: A total of 243 participants (154 [63.4%] male; mean [SD] age, 34.73 [10.33] years) were randomized to an intervention group (n=119) that gained access to a self-guided internet-based intervention during 6 weeks or a wait-listed control group (n=124).

Results showed a significantly greater reduction in gambling-related thoughts and behavior (mean difference, −3.35; 95% CI, −4.79 to −1.91; P<.001; Cohen d=0.59), depressive symptoms (mean difference, −1.05; 95% CI, −1.87 to −0.22; P=.01; Cohen d=0.33), and gambling severity (mean difference, −1.46; 95% CI, −2.37 to −0.54; P=.002; Cohen d=0.40) but not in gambling-specific dysfunctional thoughts (mean difference, −1.62; 95% CI, −3.40 to 0.15; P=.07; Cohen d=0.23) favoring the intervention group.

Thus, we aimed to (1) develop a low-dropout unguided intervention named GAMBOT integrated with a messaging app; and (2) investigate its effect. The present study was a randomised, quadruple-blind, controlled trial. We set pre-to-post change in the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) as the primary outcome and pre-to-post change in the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale (G-SAS) as a secondary outcome. Daily monitoring, personalised feedback, and private messages based on cognitive behavioural theory were offered to participants in the intervention group through a messaging app for 28 days (GAMBOT). Participants in the control group received biweekly messages only for assessments for 28 days (assessments only). A total of 197 problem gamblers were included in the primary analysis. We failed to demonstrate a significant between-group difference in the primary outcome (PGSI − 1.14, 95% CI − 2.75 to 0.47, p = 0.162) but in the secondary outcome (G-SAS − 3.14, 95% CI − 0.24 to − 6.04, p = 0.03). Only 6.7% of the participants dropped out during follow-up and 77% of the GAMBOT group participants (74/96) continued to participate in the intervention throughout the 28-day period. Integrating intervention into a chatbot feature on a frequently used messaging app shows promise in helping to overcome the high dropout rate of unguided internet-delivered interventions. More effective and sophisticated contents delivered by a chatbot should be sought to engage over 90% of problem gamblers who are reluctant to seek face-to-face support.";"Unguided Chatbot-Delivered Cognitive Behavioural Intervention for Problem Gamblers Through Messaging App: A Randomised Controlled Trial";"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-020-09935-4";"Journal of Gambling Studies";"So, 2020";"So_2020_msd_post_4_gambling_frequency_global-freq_cbt_ao_NA_NA";-0,101539515205685;0,147398881420747;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

To date, there have been no controlled clinical studies of mindfulness for problem gambling (beyond case studies) despite the well-established presence of irrational beliefs and cognitive distortions which would suggest that mindfulness interventions would be particularly suitable. In the present study, a group, five-session, mindfulness intervention was integrated into an empirically-effective cognitive-behavioral therapy for problem gamblers. Compared to a wait list control the mindfulness intervention significantly reduced the severity of gambling, gambling urges and psychiatric symptoms at end-of-treatment. At the 3-month follow-up combining the results of both groups the results were maintained. In addition, a significant decrease in the proportion of the sample meeting criteria for pathological gambling was found. Those individuals who reported some mindfulness practice post-treatment showed significantly better clinical outcomes than did those who did not report any mindfulness practice suggesting that mindfulness did play a role in the outcomes observed. Taking into consideration the multiple methodological limitations of this pilot study there is sufficient evidence to further investigate the potential efficacy of mindfulness interventions for problem gambling.";"Mindfulness-Enhanced Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Problem Gambling: A Controlled Pilot Study";"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-014-9481-6";"International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction";"Toneatto, 2014";"Toneatto_2014_msd_post_7_gambling_severity_dsm-iv_cbt_wl_NA_NA";-1,14079843866459;0,511935779884105;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA

Significant decreases in gambling severity and frequencies of gambling were found in the experimental group. The findings also showed that a change in gambling cognitions predicted the changes in gambling severity and gambling urge while a change in gambling severity was also linked to a change in depression.

The experimental group received 10 weekly CBT group sessions and individual counseling services while control group only received the individual counseling services. Significant decreases in gambling severity and frequencies of gambling were found in the experimental group. The findings also showed that a change in gambling cognitions predicted the changes in gambling severity and gambling urge while a change in gambling severity was also linked to a change in depression.

This study was conducted online using questionnaires and the LINE app. Participants were recruited through online surveys. All outcomes were assessed using Internet-based questionnaires. We used a linear mixed model to assess the effects of GAMCHECK on scores for the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale (GSAS) as the primary outcome; secondary outcomes were the Gambling Related Cognitions Scale (GRCS), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C), number of gambling days, money spent on gambling, and help-seeking behaviors. With data from 274 participants (GAMCHECK: n = 141; AO: n = 133), we demonstrated that GAMCHECK was more effective solely on GRCS than AO at both oneweek and four-week follow-up. Furthermore, by the 12-week follow-up, GAMCHECK significantly more effective than AO on gambling symptoms measured by the GSAS, number of gambling days and amount of money spent on gambling during the prior week, GRCS, and PGI-C at 12-week follow-up. No significant effects were found for help-seeking behaviors. Cognitive distortion mediated the effect on change in GSAS scores. GAMCHECK was significantly effective in improving gambling symptoms, number of gambling days, amount of money spent on gambling, and cognitive distortion. However, regarding helpseeking behavior, further refinement of GAMCHECK is necessary to motivate problem gamblers to take actions to solve their problems.";"Effectiveness of Internet‑Based Personalized Normative Feedback Among Individuals Experiencing Problem Gambling: Randomized Controlled Trial";"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-024-10364-w";"Journal of Gambling Studies";"Yokomitsu, 2025";"Yokomitsu_2025_msd_post_1_gambling_severity_gsas_pfi_ao_NA_NA";0,0658036226523359;0,142851863978446;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA
