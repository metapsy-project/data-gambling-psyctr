There is substantial investment in publicly funded intervention services, but limited evaluation of effectiveness. This study investigated three brief telephone interventions to determine whether they were more effective than standard helpline treatment in helping people to reduce gambling. Design: Randomized clinical trial. Setting: National gambling helpline in New Zealand. Participants: A total of 462 adults with problem gambling. INTERVENTIONS AND COMPARATOR: (1) Single motivational interview (MI), (2) single motivational interview plus cognitive-behavioural self-help workbook (MI + W) and (3) single motivational interview plus workbook plus four booster follow-up telephone interviews (MI + W + B). Comparator was helpline standard care [treatment as usual (TAU)]. Blinded follow-up was at 3, 6 and 12 months. Measurements: Primary outcomes were days gambled, dollars lost per day and treatment goal success. Findings: There were no differences across treatment arms, although participants showed large reductions in gambling during the 12-month follow-up period [mean reduction of 5.5 days, confidence interval (CI) = 4.8, 6.2; NZ$38 lost ($32, $44; 80.6%), improved (77.2%, 84.0%)]. Subgroup analysis revealed improved days gambled and dollars lost for MI + W + B over MI or MI + W for a goal of reduction of gambling (versus quitting) and improvement in dollars lost by ethnicity, gambling severity and psychological distress (all P < 0.01). MI + W + B was associated with greater treatment goal success for higher gambling severity than TAU or MI at 12 months and also better for those with higher psychological distress and lower self-efficacy to MI (all P < 0.01). TAU and MI were found to be equivalent in terms of dollars lost. Conclusions: In treatment of problem gambling in New Zealand, brief telephone interventions are associated with changes in days gambling and dollars lost similar to more intensive interventions, suggesting that more treatment is not necessarily better than less. Some client subgroups, in particular those with greater problem severity and greater distress, achieve better outcomes when they receive more intensive treatment.";"Brief telephone interventions for problem gambling: a randomized controlled trial";"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.14149";"Addiction";"Abbott, 2018";"NA"

Design: Randomized clinical trial. Setting: National gambling helpline in New Zealand. Participants: A total of 462 adults with problem gambling. INTERVENTIONS AND COMPARATOR: (1) Single motivational interview (MI), (2) single motivational interview plus cognitive-behavioural self-help workbook (MI + W) and (3) single motivational interview plus workbook plus four booster follow-up telephone interviews (MI + W + B). Comparator was helpline standard care [treatment as usual (TAU)]. Blinded follow-up was at 3, 6 and 12 months. Measurements: Primary outcomes were days gambled, dollars lost per day and treatment goal success. Findings: There were no differences across treatment arms, although participants showed large reductions in gambling during the 12-month follow-up period [mean reduction of 5.5 days, confidence interval (CI) = 4.8, 6.2; NZ$38 lost ($32, $44; 80.6%), improved (77.2%, 84.0%)]. Subgroup analysis revealed improved days gambled and dollars lost for MI + W + B over MI or MI + W for a goal of reduction of gambling (versus quitting) and improvement in dollars lost by ethnicity, gambling severity and psychological distress (all P < 0.01). MI + W + B was associated with greater treatment goal success for higher gambling severity than TAU or MI at 12 months and also better for those with higher psychological distress and lower self-efficacy to MI (all P < 0.01). TAU and MI were found to be equivalent in terms of dollars lost. Conclusions: In treatment of problem gambling in New Zealand, brief telephone interventions are associated with changes in days gambling and dollars lost similar to more intensive interventions, suggesting that more treatment is not necessarily better than less. Some client subgroups, in particular those with greater problem severity and greater distress, achieve better outcomes when they receive more intensive treatment.";"Brief telephone interventions for problem gambling: a randomized controlled trial";"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.14149";"Addiction";"Abbott, 2018";"NA"

The potential of internet-based interventions that are more targeted at issues specific to gambling should be evaluated in future studies.";"Effects of a depression-focused internet intervention in slot machine gamblers: a randomized controlled trial";"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198859";"PLOS ONE";"Bücker, 2018";"NA"

Gambling-related measures derived from timeline follow-back as well as general levels of anxiety and depression were administered at baseline, termination, and 6 and 12 months posttermination. Treatment showed superiority in some areas over the no-treatment control in the short term, including the primary outcome measure. No differences were found between MI and CBGT at any point in time. Instead, both MI and CBGT produced significant within-group decreases on most outcome measures up to the 12-month follow-up.

Currently, no clinical trial has included non–treatment-seeking patients who have been recruited directly in their gambling environment. This study was the first exclusively Internet-based randomized controlled trial among non–help-seeking problem gamblers with naturalistic recruitment in their gambling environment. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of three modalities of Internet-based psychotherapies with or without guidance, compared to a control condition, among problem gamblers who play online poker. Methods: All active poker gamblers on the Winamax website were systematically offered screening. All problem poker gamblers identified with a Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) score of ≥5 were eligible to be included in the trial. Problem gamblers were randomized into four groups: (1) waiting list (control group), (2) personalized normalized feedback on their gambling status by email, (3) an email containing a self-help book to be downloaded with a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) program without guidance, and (4) the same CBT program emailed weekly by a trained psychologist with personalized guidance. Efficacy was assessed based on the change in PGSI between baseline and 6 weeks (end of treatment) or 12 weeks (maintenance) and supported by player account-based gambling data automatically collected at the three time points. Results: All groups met high attrition rates (83%), but the group with guidance had a significantly higher dropout rate than the other three groups, including the control group. Although all groups showed some improvement, with a mean decrease of 1.35 on the PGSI, no significant difference in efficacy between the groups was observed. One-third of the problem gamblers fell below the problem gambling threshold at 6 weeks. Conclusions: Guidance could have aversively affected problem gamblers who had not sought help.

Currently, no clinical trial has included non–treatment-seeking patients who have been recruited directly in their gambling environment. This study was the first exclusively Internet-based randomized controlled trial among non–help-seeking problem gamblers with naturalistic recruitment in their gambling environment. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of three modalities of Internet-based psychotherapies with or without guidance, compared to a control condition, among problem gamblers who play online poker. Methods: All active poker gamblers on the Winamax website were systematically offered screening. All problem poker gamblers identified with a Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) score of ≥5 were eligible to be included in the trial. Problem gamblers were randomized into four groups: (1) waiting list (control group), (2) personalized normalized feedback on their gambling status by email, (3) an email containing a self-help book to be downloaded with a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) program without guidance, and (4) the same CBT program emailed weekly by a trained psychologist with personalized guidance. Efficacy was assessed based on the change in PGSI between baseline and 6 weeks (end of treatment) or 12 weeks (maintenance) and supported by player account-based gambling data automatically collected at the three time points. Results: All groups met high attrition rates (83%), but the group with guidance had a significantly higher dropout rate than the other three groups, including the control group. Although all groups showed some improvement, with a mean decrease of 1.35 on the PGSI, no significant difference in efficacy between the groups was observed.

Currently, no clinical trial has included non–treatment-seeking patients who have been recruited directly in their gambling environment. This study was the first exclusively Internet-based randomized controlled trial among non–help-seeking problem gamblers with naturalistic recruitment in their gambling environment. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of three modalities of Internet-based psychotherapies with or without guidance, compared to a control condition, among problem gamblers who play online poker. Methods: All active poker gamblers on the Winamax website were systematically offered screening. All problem poker gamblers identified with a Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) score of ≥5 were eligible to be included in the trial. Problem gamblers were randomized into four groups: (1) waiting list (control group), (2) personalized normalized feedback on their gambling status by email, (3) an email containing a self-help book to be downloaded with a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) program without guidance, and (4) the same CBT program emailed weekly by a trained psychologist with personalized guidance. Efficacy was assessed based on the change in PGSI between baseline and 6 weeks (end of treatment) or 12 weeks (maintenance) and supported by player account-based gambling data automatically collected at the three time points. Results: All groups met high attrition rates (83%), but the group with guidance had a significantly higher dropout rate than the other three groups, including the control group. Although all groups showed some improvement, with a mean decrease of 1.35 on the PGSI, no significant difference in efficacy between the groups was observed. One-third of the problem gamblers fell below the problem gambling threshold at 6 weeks. Conclusions: Guidance could have aversively affected problem gamblers who had not sought help. Despite the lack of significant difference in efficacy between groups, this naturalistic trial provides a basis for the development of future Internet-based trials in individuals with gambling disorders.

Brief interventions that incorporate personalized feedback have been efficacious at reducing gambling and related problems. The purpose of the present study was to examine the efficacy of personalized feedback-based interventions delivered via smartphone and text message. Participants were 255 students who met our screening criteria for ‘‘problem’’ or ‘‘pathological’’ gambling, and were randomized to one of three conditions: personalized feedback and follow-up targeted text messages (PFB-TXT); personalized feedback and follow-up educational information about gambling (PFB-EDU); and a control condition that received no personalized feedback or follow-up text messages. Dependent variables included percent days abstinent (PDA) from gambling, average amount wagered on a gambling day, and gambling-related problems. Results indicated that the PFB conditions did not have a direct effect relative to the control condition on the dependent variables at the six-month follow-up, but a statistically significant mediated effect on gambling-related problems via gambling norms did emerge at one-month. No differences between the two PFB conditions in terms of direct or indirect effects on the six-month outcome variables were determined. Findings from this study suggest that the personalized text condition did not provide greater efficacy in changing gambling-related outcomes over general educational messages with personalized feedback. To help explain the lack of direct intervention effects, we explored two hypotheses related to our study design and sample of gamblers.";"The Efficacy of Personalized Feedback Interventions Delivered via Smartphone among At-Risk College Student Gamblers";"https://cdspress.ca/?p=8732";"Journal of Gambling Issues";"McAfee, 2020";"NA"

Participants were 255 students who met our screening criteria for ‘‘problem’’ or ‘‘pathological’’ gambling, and were randomized to one of three conditions: personalized feedback and follow-up targeted text messages (PFB-TXT); personalized feedback and follow-up educational information about gambling (PFB-EDU); and a control condition that received no personalized feedback or follow-up text messages. Dependent variables included percent days abstinent (PDA) from gambling, average amount wagered on a gambling day, and gambling-related problems. Results indicated that the PFB conditions did not have a direct effect relative to the control condition on the dependent variables at the six-month follow-up, but a statistically significant mediated effect on gambling-related problems via gambling norms did emerge at one-month. No differences between the two PFB conditions in terms of direct or indirect effects on the six-month outcome variables were determined. Findings from this study suggest that the personalized text condition did not provide greater efficacy in changing gambling-related outcomes over general educational messages with personalized feedback. To help explain the lack of direct intervention effects, we explored two hypotheses related to our study design and sample of gamblers.";"The Efficacy of Personalized Feedback Interventions Delivered via Smartphone among At-Risk College Student Gamblers";"https://cdspress.ca/?p=8732";"Journal of Gambling Issues";"McAfee, 2020";"NA"

Personalized normative feedback (PNF) is a brief intervention designed to correct misperceptions regarding the prevalence of problematic behavior by showing individuals engaging in such behaviors that their own behavior is atypical with respect to actual norms. The current randomized controlled trial evaluated a computer-delivered PNF intervention for problem gambling college students. Method: Following a baseline assessment, 252 college student gamblers scoring 2+ on the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) were randomly assigned to receive PNF or attention-control feedback. Follow-up assessments were completed 3 and 6 months postintervention. Results: Results indicated significant intervention effects in reducing perceived norms for quantities lost and won, and in reducing actual quantity lost and gambling problems at the 3-month follow-up. All intervention effects except reduced gambling problems remained at the 6-month follow-up. Mediation results indicated that changes in perceived norms at 3 months mediated the intervention effects. Further, the intervention effects were moderated by self-identification with other student gamblers, suggesting that PNF worked better at reducing gambling for those who more strongly identified with other student gamblers. Conclusions: Results support the use of PNF as a stand-alone brief intervention for at-risk gambling students. Extending this approach more broadly may provide an accessible, empirically supported gambling prevention option for universities and related institutions. ";"Efficacy of personalized normative feedback as a brief intervention for college student gambling: A randomized controlled trial";"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-23039-001";"Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology";"Neighbors, 2015";"NA"

Results showed significant improvements at post-treatment in gambling behaviors including frequency of gambling, average amount gambled per day and PG symptoms as well as a number of gambling correlates including psychological states (e.g., depression, anxiety and stress), gambling cognitions, gambling urges, gambling related self-efficacy, satisfaction with life, and quality of life among those who completed the SHCBT program, when compared with the waitlist condition. The effect size (partial η 2) ranged from .25 to .57 for all assessed outcomes that showed significant improvement from pre- to post-treatment.

Problem gamblers (N = 180) were randomly assigned to assessment only control, 10 min of brief advice, 1 session of motivational enhancement therapy (MET), or 1 session of MET plus 3 sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Gambling was assessed at baseline, at 6 weeks, and at a 9-month follow-up. Relative to assessment only, brief advice was the only condition that significantly decreased gambling between baseline and Week 6, and it was associated with clinically significant reductions in gambling at Month 9.

The three interventions were designed to reduce gambling. Measurements: Gambling was assessed at baseline, week 6 and month 9 using the Addiction Severity Index–gambling (ASI-G) module, which also assesses days and dollars wagered. Findings: Compared to the assessment-only condition, those receiving any intervention had significant decreases in ASI-G scores and days and dollars wagered over time. The MET condition decreased significantly ASI-G scores and dollars wagered over time, and increased the odds of a clinically significant reduction in gambling at the 9-month follow-up relative to the assessment-only condition, even after controlling for baseline indices that could impact outcomes.

Results: In the sample as a whole, days and dollars wagered and gambling problems decreased markedly from baseline through Month 5; thereafter, reductions in dollars wagered and gambling problems continued to decrease modestly but significantly, and days gambled remained constant. Brief advice significantly reduced days gambled between baseline and Month 5 relative to brief psychoeducation.

Method: Substance abuse treatment patients with gambling problems (N = 217) were randomly assigned to a 10- to 15-min brief psychoeducation gambling intervention; a 10- to 15-min brief advice intervention addressing gambling norms, risk factors, and methods to prevent additional problems; or 4 50-min sessions of motivational enhancement therapy plus cognitive behavior therapy for reducing gambling (MET + CBT). Gambling and related problems were assessed at baseline and throughout 24 months. Results: In the sample as a whole, days and dollars wagered and gambling problems decreased markedly from baseline through Month 5; thereafter, reductions in dollars wagered and gambling problems continued to decrease modestly but significantly, and days gambled remained constant. Brief advice significantly reduced days gambled between baseline and Month 5 relative to brief psychoeducation. The MET + CBT condition engendered no benefit beyond brief advice in terms of days gambled but did lead to more precipitous reductions in dollars gambled and problems experienced in the initial 5 months, and greater clinically significant improvements in gambling in both the short and long term. MET + CBT also resulted in initial decreases in self-reported alcohol use and problems but did not differentially impact self-reported illicit drug use or submission of positive samples.

We failed to demonstrate a significant between-group difference in the primary outcome (PGSI − 1.14, 95% CI − 2.75 to 0.47, p = 0.162) but in the secondary outcome (G-SAS − 3.14, 95% CI − 0.24 to − 6.04, p = 0.03). Only 6.7% of the participants dropped out during follow-up and 77% of the GAMBOT group participants (74/96) continued to participate in the intervention throughout the 28-day period. Integrating intervention into a chatbot feature on a frequently used messaging app shows promise in helping to overcome the high dropout rate of unguided internet-delivered interventions. More effective and sophisticated contents delivered by a chatbot should be sought to engage over 90% of problem gamblers who are reluctant to seek face-to-face support.";"Unguided Chatbot-Delivered Cognitive Behavioural Intervention for Problem Gamblers Through Messaging App: A Randomised Controlled Trial";"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-020-09935-4";"Journal of Gambling Studies";"So, 2020";"NA"

To date, there have been no controlled clinical studies of mindfulness for problem gambling (beyond case studies) despite the well-established presence of irrational beliefs and cognitive distortions which would suggest that mindfulness interventions would be particularly suitable. In the present study, a group, five-session, mindfulness intervention was integrated into an empirically-effective cognitive-behavioral therapy for problem gamblers. Compared to a wait list control the mindfulness intervention significantly reduced the severity of gambling, gambling urges and psychiatric symptoms at end-of-treatment. At the 3-month follow-up combining the results of both groups the results were maintained. In addition, a significant decrease in the proportion of the sample meeting criteria for pathological gambling was found. Those individuals who reported some mindfulness practice post-treatment showed significantly better clinical outcomes than did those who did not report any mindfulness practice suggesting that mindfulness did play a role in the outcomes observed. Taking into consideration the multiple methodological limitations of this pilot study there is sufficient evidence to further investigate the potential efficacy of mindfulness interventions for problem gambling.";"Mindfulness-Enhanced Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Problem Gambling: A Controlled Pilot Study";"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-014-9481-6";"International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction";"Toneatto, 2014";"NA"

Participants were followed up weekly during the intervention, post intervention, and 6 weeks upon completion of intervention. Participants: A total of 43 self-identified individuals with gambling problems (scoring 3 or more on the Problem Gambling Severity Index) were recruited via the Swedish national gambling helpline, 59% females, mean age 43.7 years. Measurements: Feasibility of the procedure and intervention (i.e., recruitment pace, attrition, program engagement, and satisfaction) were the primary outcomes; treatment effect (net gambling losses) was the secondary outcome. Results: Approximately 2 participants per week were randomized, and retention was low, with 47% lost to follow-up at the 6-week follow-up time-point. Most participants engaged in the online modules (86%) and rated their overall satisfaction with the program as high (7.5 out of 10).
